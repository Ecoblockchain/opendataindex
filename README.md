# Open Data Index

This is the code that powers the [Open Data Index](http://index.okfn.org/).

Just ported from Jekyll to Pelican. No docs yet. See [Pelican docs](http://docs.getpelican.com)

### but briefly

* setup a virtual env
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* pelican content to build, or ./develop-server to run a server that watches and builds
