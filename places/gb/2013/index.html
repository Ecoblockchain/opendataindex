&lt;p&gt;This means that we are looking only for what is officially published by governments. In some cases, the government will give the right to publish the data to third parties and in such cases submissions linking to third party sites are valid. It must, however, be explicitly stated on the data site that it is commissioned by the government (if the data is to be found on a company domain or on a domain of a civil society organisation or initiative, check if the organization has an agreement with the government to be the official source).&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-file-alt"></i>&nbsp;</li>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that data can be digital, but not accessible online&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: A country budget can be stored on a private network in the government, but not on the Internet. This means that the data is digital, but not publicly accessible, (which is our next criteria, see further below). Still, if you have knowledge that the data is digital somewhere inside the government (for instance, if the government official you speak to tells you so), then you should mark this one “YES” (and add in the notes that you have the information from a phone call with a certain department or official person).&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-save"></i>&nbsp;</li>

&lt;p&gt;Data is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; publicly available in the following cases:
1. It can be made available only after a freedom of information request (FOIA) is sent.
2. It can be accessed only by government officials.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-eye-open"></i>&nbsp;</li>

          <li class="yes" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;p&gt;Is the data machine readable&lt;/p&gt;" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Files are digital, yes, but not all can be  processed or parsed easily by a computer.  In order to answer this question, you would need to look at the datasets file type.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb the following file types are machine readable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XLS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JSON&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the files are in the following formats, the are NOT machine readable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PDF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JIF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JPEG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PPT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a different file type and you don’t know if it’s machine readable or not, send an email to the Open Data Census list.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-keyboard"></i>&nbsp;</li>


          <li class="yes" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;p&gt;Available in bulk&lt;/p&gt;" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Data is available in bulk if the whole dataset can be downloaded easily.

          <li class="yes" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;p&gt;Openly licensed&lt;/p&gt;" data-content="&lt;p&gt;This mean the data term and conditions follows The Open Definition, which stipulates that in order for data to be open, it needs to be free to use, reuse or to redistribute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which licenses are open?&lt;/em&gt;
On the site of The Open Definition you can also see a directory of licenses that are certified open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can you find the license?&lt;/em&gt;
That can sometimes be the tricky part. 
Usually, license or Terms &amp;amp; Conditions can be found at the bottom of the website (linked in the footer) or under the website “About” section. If there is no visible license or the license is under the country&#39;s name, for example - “Copyrighted under the state of Lebanon” and there is no terms and condition or any other information on the site, the information is not open and you should answer “No”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the information is licenced under Creative Commons licences, like in the case of Australia for instance, then the data is openly licensed (except if they are using Creative Commons’ non-commercial licenses - the ones with “NC” or “ND” in them - these are partially open, but not fully open according to The Open Definition - and therefore in this case to be considered not open). 
Note that sometimes countries do not license under Creative Commons, but the terms and conditions do allow use, re-use and distribution.  In that case we suggest you write to the Open Data Census list and get feedback from the community.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-unlock-alt"></i>&nbsp;</li>


          <li class="yes" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;p&gt;Is the data provided on a timely and up to date basis&lt;/p&gt;" data-content="&lt;p&gt;This means if the data is relevant to the year/time it is suppose to represent? Click &#34;Show more&#34; to learn about how to find information for this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if the latest national budget made available is from 2010, then it is not up-to-date. However, not all datasets need to be updated in the same frequencies. Transportation data can be updated on a daily basis while postal codes might not change for many years. Refere to the tutorial if you are having difficulties to decide the best time option for this dataset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to find when the data was published?&lt;/em&gt;
- If the dataset was found on a government portal, there will most often be a timestamp attached to it. 
- If the data was on the a government site, sometimes the date will be written next to the dataset link or in the news section. 
- Sometimes the date stamp is in the dataset itself. For example, a tab that is named after the date it suppose to represent (you can also try to download the data and see the creation date of the file, although that might not represent the right date - use your judgement and again, leave good comments about your assessment). 
- Lastly, sometimes there are no timestamps at all. In that case,it might be most fair to mark it not timely or up-to-date&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-time"></i>&nbsp;</li>

- Sometimes the date stamp is in the dataset itself.

There is an annual "Budget speech" and documents are published online by HM Treasury and are re-useable under the terms of the UK's Open Government Licence. Main documents are in PDF but some raw data is also provided in Excel format. However this does not usually include detailed departmental budgets. Departmental level budgets are in a number of places, but the two collections available regularly free of charge under the UK Open Government Licence are: (1) the annual "Estimates" published each April for the financial year commencing that April. These are published in PDF format department by department and are at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hmt-main-estimates for the last three years 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14. This dataset is "up to date" (2) the same, and some more detailed, data is contained in the "Plans" part of the COINS/OSCAR dataset http://data.gov.uk/dataset/coins (this also contains matching expenditure information). Although the expenditure information is published quarterly, the "plans" are not currently published in COINS data until the end of the financial year to which they relate. Once Plans information is available on COINS it is available for bulk download in machine readable format (CSV). In assessing the ratings fairly it was necessary to choose between the "Estimates" and "COINS" versions - the COINS version seemed closer to the ideal, even though it was not as up to date, and that is assessed here.">

That can sometimes be the tricky part. 
Usually, license or Terms &amp;amp; Conditions can be found at the bottom of the website (linked in the footer) or under the website “About” section.

- If the data was on the a government site, sometimes the date will be written next to the dataset link or in the news section. 
- Sometimes the date stamp is in the dataset itself. For example, a tab that is named after the date it suppose to represent (you can also try to download the data and see the creation date of the file, although that might not represent the right date - use your judgement and again, leave good comments about your assessment).

          <li class="no" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;p&gt;Available in bulk&lt;/p&gt;" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Data is available in bulk if the whole dataset can be downloaded easily. It is considered non-bulk if the citizens are limited to getting parts of the dataset through an online interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if restricted to querying a web form and retrieving a few results at a time from a very large database.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-copy"></i>&nbsp;</li>


          <li class="yes" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;p&gt;Openly licensed&lt;/p&gt;" data-content="&lt;p&gt;This mean the data term and conditions follows The Open Definition, which stipulates that in order for data to be open, it needs to be free to use, reuse or to redistribute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which licenses are open?&lt;/em&gt;
On the site of The Open Definition you can also see a directory of licenses that are certified open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can you find the license?&lt;/em&gt;
That can sometimes be the tricky part. 
Usually, license or Terms &amp;amp; Conditions can be found at the bottom of the website (linked in the footer) or under the website “About” section. If there is no visible license or the license is under the country&#39;s name, for example - “Copyrighted under the state of Lebanon” and there is no terms and condition or any other information on the site, the information is not open and you should answer “No”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the information is licenced under Creative Commons licences, like in the case of Australia for instance, then the data is openly licensed (except if they are using Creative Commons’ non-commercial licenses - the ones with “NC” or “ND” in them - these are partially open, but not fully open according to The Open Definition - and therefore in this case to be considered not open). 
Note that sometimes countries do not license under Creative Commons, but the terms and conditions do allow use, re-use and distribution.  In that case we suggest you write to the Open Data Census list and get feedback from the community.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-unlock-alt"></i>&nbsp;</li>


          <li class="yes" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;p&gt;Is the data provided on a timely and up to date basis&lt;/p&gt;" data-content="&lt;p&gt;This means if the data is relevant to the year/time it is suppose to represent? Click &#34;Show more&#34; to learn about how to find information for this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if the latest national budget made available is from 2010, then it is not up-to-date. However, not all datasets need to be updated in the same frequencies. Transportation data can be updated on a daily basis while postal codes might not change for many years. Refere to the tutorial if you are having difficulties to decide the best time option for this dataset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to find when the data was published?&lt;/em&gt;
- If the dataset was found on a government portal, there will most often be a timestamp attached to it. 
- If the data was on the a government site, sometimes the date will be written next to the dataset link or in the news section. 
- Sometimes the date stamp is in the dataset itself. For example, a tab that is named after the date it suppose to represent (you can also try to download the data and see the creation date of the file, although that might not represent the right date - use your judgement and again, leave good comments about your assessment). 
- Lastly, sometimes there are no timestamps at all. In that case,it might be most fair to mark it not timely or up-to-date&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-time"></i>&nbsp;</li>

      <td title="Realtime and recent historical data about *observed* levels of air pollutants and particulates at 128 automatic observing stations across the UK are at http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk. Pollutants covered include Ozone, Nitric oxide, Nitrogen dioxide, Nitrogen oxides as nitrogen dioxide, Sulphur dioxide, Carbon monoxide, PM10 particulate matter, Non-volatile PM10, Volatile PM10, PM2.5 particulate matter, Non-volatile PM2.5, and Volatile PM2.5. All this data is under the Open Government Licence. An RSS feed of latest data is available at http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/rss/current_site_levels.xml , although this points to HTML pages such as http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/site-data?f_site_id=ACTH&view=last_hour . The Data Selector http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/data_selector allows a custom table to be constructed and either viewed or sent to the requestor as a CSV file. However there is a limit on the extent of the query (one test-drive for the Census gave "The selection you requested will return 1176 rows of data in 770 columns. This exceeds our limit of 256 columns."). This meets the Census requirement, apart from bulk download. In addition national estimates of annual *emissions* of 36 air pollutants from 1971-2011 are downloadable in CSV format under the Open Government Licence from http://naei.defra.gov.uk/data/data-selector, but again this is in the form of a table-builder and it does not seem possible to download all the data in bulk. Further public environmental data for the UK is maintained by several public bodies (mainly the Environment Agency for England and Wales, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, plus Defra and DECC). Broadly speaking, data on major sources of pollutants is readily available via Government websites and public mapping applications. Some complete datasets are available as open data, notably from Defra: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs/series/air-quality-and-emissions-statistics. Some environmental data is subject to additional licensing arrangements - see for instance http://www.geostore.com/environment-agency/WebStore?xml=environment-agency/xml/ogcDataDownload.xml">
