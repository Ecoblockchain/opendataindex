&lt;p&gt;This means that we are looking only for what is officially published by governments. In some cases, the government will give the right to publish the data to third parties and in such cases submissions linking to third party sites are valid. It must, however, be explicitly stated on the data site that it is commissioned by the government (if the data is to be found on a company domain or on a domain of a civil society organisation or initiative, check if the organization has an agreement with the government to be the official source).&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-file-alt"></i>&nbsp;</li>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that data can be digital, but not accessible online&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: A country budget can be stored on a private network in the government, but not on the Internet. This means that the data is digital, but not publicly accessible, (which is our next criteria, see further below). Still, if you have knowledge that the data is digital somewhere inside the government (for instance, if the government official you speak to tells you so), then you should mark this one “YES” (and add in the notes that you have the information from a phone call with a certain department or official person).&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-save"></i>&nbsp;</li>

1. It can be accessed online without the need for a password or permissions.
2. If the data is in paper form, can be accessed by the public and there is no restrictions on the number of photocopies that can be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; publicly available in the following cases:
1. It can be made available only after a freedom of information request (FOIA) is sent.
2. It can be accessed only by government officials.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-eye-open"></i>&nbsp;</li>


          <li class="yes" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;p&gt;Is the data available for free&lt;/p&gt;" data-content="&lt;p&gt;If you have to pay for it – it is not free.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-dollar"></i>&nbsp;</li>

          <li class="no" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;p&gt;Is the data machine readable&lt;/p&gt;" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Files are digital, yes, but not all can be  processed or parsed easily by a computer.  In order to answer this question, you would need to look at the datasets file type.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb the following file types are machine readable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XLS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JSON&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the files are in the following formats, the are NOT machine readable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PDF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JIF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JPEG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PPT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a different file type and you don’t know if it’s machine readable or not, send an email to the Open Data Census list.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-keyboard"></i>&nbsp;</li>


          <li class="no" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;p&gt;Available in bulk&lt;/p&gt;" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Data is available in bulk if the whole dataset can be downloaded easily.

&lt;p&gt;For example, if restricted to querying a web form and retrieving a few results at a time from a very large database.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-copy"></i>&nbsp;</li>


          <li class="no" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;p&gt;Openly licensed&lt;/p&gt;" data-content="&lt;p&gt;This mean the data term and conditions follows The Open Definition, which stipulates that in order for data to be open, it needs to be free to use, reuse or to redistribute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which licenses are open?&lt;/em&gt;
On the site of The Open Definition you can also see a directory of licenses that are certified open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can you find the license?&lt;/em&gt;
That can sometimes be the tricky part. 
Usually, license or Terms &amp;amp; Conditions can be found at the bottom of the website (linked in the footer) or under the website “About” section. If there is no visible license or the license is under the country&#39;s name, for example - “Copyrighted under the state of Lebanon” and there is no terms and condition or any other information on the site, the information is not open and you should answer “No”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the information is licenced under Creative Commons licences, like in the case of Australia for instance, then the data is openly licensed (except if they are using Creative Commons’ non-commercial licenses - the ones with “NC” or “ND” in them - these are partially open, but not fully open according to The Open Definition - and therefore in this case to be considered not open). 
Note that sometimes countries do not license under Creative Commons, but the terms and conditions do allow use, re-use and distribution.  In that case we suggest you write to the Open Data Census list and get feedback from the community.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-unlock-alt"></i>&nbsp;</li>


          <li class="yes" data-toggle="popover" title="&lt;p&gt;Is the data provided on a timely and up to date basis&lt;/p&gt;" data-content="&lt;p&gt;This means if the data is relevant to the year/time it is suppose to represent? Click &#34;Show more&#34; to learn about how to find information for this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if the latest national budget made available is from 2010, then it is not up-to-date. However, not all datasets need to be updated in the same frequencies. Transportation data can be updated on a daily basis while postal codes might not change for many years. Refere to the tutorial if you are having difficulties to decide the best time option for this dataset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to find when the data was published?&lt;/em&gt;
- If the dataset was found on a government portal, there will most often be a timestamp attached to it. 
- If the data was on the a government site, sometimes the date will be written next to the dataset link or in the news section. 
- Sometimes the date stamp is in the dataset itself. For example, a tab that is named after the date it suppose to represent (you can also try to download the data and see the creation date of the file, although that might not represent the right date - use your judgement and again, leave good comments about your assessment). 
- Lastly, sometimes there are no timestamps at all. In that case,it might be most fair to mark it not timely or up-to-date&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-time"></i>&nbsp;</li>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to find when the data was published?&lt;/em&gt;
- If the dataset was found on a government portal, there will most often be a timestamp attached to it. 
- If the data was on the a government site, sometimes the date will be written next to the dataset link or in the news section. 
- Sometimes the date stamp is in the dataset itself. For example, a tab that is named after the date it suppose to represent (you can also try to download the data and see the creation date of the file, although that might not represent the right date - use your judgement and again, leave good comments about your assessment). 
- Lastly, sometimes there are no timestamps at all. In that case,it might be most fair to mark it not timely or up-to-date&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-time"></i>&nbsp;</li>

Usually, license or Terms &amp;amp; Conditions can be found at the bottom of the website (linked in the footer) or under the website “About” section.

Furthermore, there are no official statements to acknowledge any intentions of making the National Map open data. In 2012, the geo-spatial.org (http://earth.unibuc.ro/) community addressed an open letter to ANCPI, signed by 184 members asking for free access as a downloadable file or through OGC webmapping standards, of a a vector format file of the boundaries of the Romanian municipalities. ANCPI offered to give us the requested dataset, but at the price established through the Order of the Ministry of Internal Affairs no. 39/2009, which for the entire Romanian territory, is about 800.000 EURO.Today, the dataset containing the boundaries of the Romanian municipalities is the only dataset available through a visualization service compliant with INSPIRE on the geoportal maintained by ANCPI.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which licenses are open?&lt;/em&gt;
On the site of The Open Definition you can also see a directory of licenses that are certified open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can you find the license?&lt;/em&gt;
That can sometimes be the tricky part. 
Usually, license or Terms &amp;amp; Conditions can be found at the bottom of the website (linked in the footer) or under the website “About” section. If there is no visible license or the license is under the country&#39;s name, for example - “Copyrighted under the state of Lebanon” and there is no terms and condition or any other information on the site, the information is not open and you should answer “No”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the information is licenced under Creative Commons licences, like in the case of Australia for instance, then the data is openly licensed (except if they are using Creative Commons’ non-commercial licenses - the ones with “NC” or “ND” in them - these are partially open, but not fully open according to The Open Definition - and therefore in this case to be considered not open). 
Note that sometimes countries do not license under Creative Commons, but the terms and conditions do allow use, re-use and distribution.  In that case we suggest you write to the Open Data Census list and get feedback from the community.&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-unlock-alt"></i>&nbsp;</li>

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if the latest national budget made available is from 2010, then it is not up-to-date. However, not all datasets need to be updated in the same frequencies. Transportation data can be updated on a daily basis while postal codes might not change for many years. Refere to the tutorial if you are having difficulties to decide the best time option for this dataset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to find when the data was published?&lt;/em&gt;
- If the dataset was found on a government portal, there will most often be a timestamp attached to it. 
- If the data was on the a government site, sometimes the date will be written next to the dataset link or in the news section. 
- Sometimes the date stamp is in the dataset itself. For example, a tab that is named after the date it suppose to represent (you can also try to download the data and see the creation date of the file, although that might not represent the right date - use your judgement and again, leave good comments about your assessment). 
- Lastly, sometimes there are no timestamps at all. In that case,it might be most fair to mark it not timely or up-to-date&lt;/p&gt;"><i class="fa fa-time"></i>&nbsp;</li>
