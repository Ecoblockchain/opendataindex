An increasing number of governments have committed to open up data, but how much key information is actually being released? Is the available data legally and technically usable so that citizens, civil society and businesses can realise the full benefits of the information? Which countries are the most advanced and which are lagging in relation to open data? The Open Data Index is a fixed snapshot of the national Open Data Census project from October 28th, 2013, and has been developed to help answer such questions by collecting and presenting information on the state of open data around the world - to ignite discussions between citizens and governments.
